**Title:** DEDS mini-workshop: Populations of Oscillators, Organisms and Lineages (POOL)  

**Description:** The DEDS seminar/conference/workshop series is devoted to new mathematical aspects on machine learning algorithms, big data analysis, and other topics in data science area, from a viewpoint of differential equations. In recent years, several interesting connections between differential equations and data science have been found and attract attention from researchers of differential equations. In this mini-workshop we explore biological networks, collective dynamics and growing lineage systems. 

**Organizers:** Hirofumi Notsu, Thomas de Jong
