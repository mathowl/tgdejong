**Title:** Deeper understanding of synchronization and Oscillation quenching through the reduction of dynamics

**Abstract:** Oscillations are observed in various systems, including biological and　mechanical ones. When oscillators, i.e., systems exhibiting sustained　oscillations, are coupled, they often self-organize to realize　nontrivial collective states. For example, they can synchronize their　rhythms to yield macroscopic oscillations. Oscillation quenching,　where each oscillator stops its oscillation, may also occur. Each of　these collective behaviors is often important for systems to function　properly and has been studied by using various models of oscillators.　However, models that allow analytical investigation of both　synchronization and oscillation quenching are still few. In this talk,　I will introduce two such models: (1) a model of interacting　oscillators exposed to global feedback[1] and (2) a model of a　population of oscillators that turn over owing to the removal and　addition of constitutive oscillators[2]. The analyses of these models　can help us unify insights into synchronization and oscillation　quenching and help us design systems that exhibit desirable collective　dynamics.
