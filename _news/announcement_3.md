**Title:** Dynamical systems in multicellular development: applications and new
directions

**Abstract:** In this talk, I will discuss aspects of multicellular development
from the perspective of dynamical systems, focusing on two problems related
to growth and patterning of cellular networks [1, 2]. In both cases, the
state of a single cell is treated as a nonlinear dynamical system, and
systems of many cells are modeled as networks of interacting copies. First,
I will describe our recent work on the assembly of small cellular networks
that are critical for animal reproduction. We treat cells as simple
oscillators and allow each oscillator to replicate after completing a
cycle, thereby enabling network growth. By modifying three key parameters,
the model synthesizes data from a broad range of naturally occurring
cellular networks, thus establishing a foundation for theoretical
extensions and experimental validation. Next, I will discuss associative
memory models of multistable gene expression states in individual cells
(i.e., cell types). Local interactions on networks of identical cells can
produce rich tissue patterns, which we study numerically for the case of
random interactions. Together, these works suggest the study of “growing”
dynamical networks where cell-level events (e.g., limit cycles, attractor
switching) can influence the number of interacting copies, thereby enabling
hierarchical self-organization.
