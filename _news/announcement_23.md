I am main-author/co-author of **4 different works** at [EC11](https://sites.google.com/edu.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/ecc11/home). I will give a talk on harnessing Kuramoto-like systems as computational resource. The students I am supervising Ahmad Mohiuddin and Oussama Ounissi will both give poster presentations. Additionally, our work on growing oscillator networks with Matthew Smart, Hayden Nunley and Ayumi Ozawa also got selected.
