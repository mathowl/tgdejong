**Title:** Emergent hypernetworks in weakly coupled oscillators

**Abstract:** Networks of weakly coupled oscillators are of fundamental importance to our understanding of complex systems. Recent studies on model reconstruction from data have shown that hyper-connections corresponding to triplet or higher-order interactions can often emerge among the oscillators, even when such models were originally defined as networks with only pairwise interactions. We give a conceptual explanation by showing that hypernetworks can indeed appear in the presence of pairwise, albeit nonlinear, coupling given certain frequency resonance conditions. The idea is that model reconstruction finds the so-called normal form of the system instead. This in turn allows us to predict the emergent hypernetwork in terms of appearing and forbidden motifs. We moreover demonstrate these results in real-world experiments with electrochemical oscillators. This is joint work with Jorge Luis Ocampo-Espindola, Deniz Eroglu, István Z. Kiss and Tiago Pereira.
