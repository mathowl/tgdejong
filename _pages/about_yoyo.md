I am an applied mathematician. So far my application domains include cell biology, archeology, social science and celestial mechanics. My mathematical expertise mainly concerns dynamical systems and lately I am very drawn to data science and neural network problems.

For my research I mainly use Python. I have worked on a couple of mechanical and material science problems in collaboration with industry, and I am always on the look out for new collaborations.
