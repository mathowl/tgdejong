I am a mathematician. But I dabble a lot in the applied sciences. So far my application domains include AI, celestial mechanics, cell biology. My mathematical expertise mainly concerns dynamical systems and lately I am very drawn to data science and neural network problems. Currently, my main focus is reservoir computing. I am in the Notsu-lab at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in Kanazawa University. My research is funded by CREST.

For my research I mainly use Python. I have worked on a couple of mechanical and material science problems in collaboration with industry, and I am always on the look for new collaborations.

I am an organizer of the Kanazawa Analysis Seminar [KAS](http://polaris.s.kanazawa-u.ac.jp/kas/), Differential Equations for Data science Seminar [DEDS](https://scheme.hn/deds/) and Continuum Mechanics Focusing on Singularities [CoMFoS](https://sites.google.com/view/comfos23/home).
