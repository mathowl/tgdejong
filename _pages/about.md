I am an applied mathematician that computes dynamics and uses dynamics to compute. The first topic is related to biomechanical models as well as a dynamics driven perspective on AI. The second topic is my main focus and lies in the domain of physical reservoir computing which is a framework that utilizes natural physical phenomena to perform computations. 

I am a Postdoctoral researcher in the Notsu-lab at the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics in Kanazawa University. This position is funded by CREST. I also hold an Adjunct Assistant Professorship (part-time lecturing) at Temple University Japan Campus. 

For my research I mainly use Python. I have worked on a couple of mechanical and material science problems in collaboration with industry, and I am always on the look for new collaborations.

I am an organizer of the Kanazawa Analysis Seminar [KAS](http://polaris.s.kanazawa-u.ac.jp/kas/) and Differential Equations for Data Science seminar [DEDS](https://scheme.hn/deds/), if you want to join our seminar mailingslist click [here](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/deds-ku/join).

As a first generation university graduate with a lower class background I very strongly believe in a grass-roots approach to science. I am very supportive of open-source. I think that a delta-function perspective on research is outdated in the age of model-free methods.
