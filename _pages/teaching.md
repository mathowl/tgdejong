Overview:
<ul>
<li>CPU: AMD Ryzen 9 5950X</li>
<li>CPU Fan: thermalRight double fan </li>
<li>GPU: A4500 (20GB) </li>
<li>Motherboard:  Asus Prime B550M-A </li>
<li>RAM: Patriot Viper Steel 16GB x 2 </li>
</ul>

For GPU stuff I do use windows. To avoid the problematic stuff of dealing with re-installations of generic software I stick to a fixed motherboard family. Your windows then becomes plug-and-play. 

I was thinking about getting an A5000 GPU to match my CPU that but it seems a better deal to go for an A4500. An A6000 or greater is overkill and waste of research funds. A4500 sits quite close to A5000 in terms of performance and is relatively much cheaper (at least here in Japan). A4500 has 20GB which is a couple of GB greater than the applications I plan to use it for. RTX 3090 is also not too expensive but it is quite power hungry.
