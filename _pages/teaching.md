<h1>
**Dynamics of multicellular systems and applications in machine learning (MCML2024)**
</h1>

**Date:** October 23-24:  
**Location:**  Kanazawa 
**Registration link:** soon available

This meeting will bring together quantitative biologists, mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists to 

<ul>
    <li> explore how cells coordinate their behavior to carry out developmental programs and establish tissue-scale patterns 
    </li>
    <li> present data-driven and machine learning approaches to discover mechanisms underlying the self-organization of multicellular systems 
    </li>  
    <li> identify and harness multicellular systems as a next generation computational resource (via frameworks such as reservoir computing)
    </li> 
</ul>

**Organizers:**

Hirofumi Notsu (Kanazawa University)
Makoto Sato  (Kanazawa University)
Ayumi Ozawa (JAMSTEC)
Matthew Smart (Flatiron Institute)
Hayden Nunley (Flatiron Institute)
Thomas de Jong (Kanazawa University)

(site will be up later today(=14 september))

<h1> **Differential Equations for Data Science (DEDS2025)** </h1>

**Date:** February 11-13
**Location:** Kyoto
**Registration link:** available in October

This conference is mainly devoted to new mathematical aspects on machine learning algorithms, big data analysis, and other topics in data science area, from a viewpoint of differential equations. In recent years, several interesting connections between differential equations and data science have been found and attract attention from researchers of differential equations. In this conference, we will gather such researchers of differential equations who have interest in data science and try to shed new light on mathematical foundations on the topics in machine learning/data science.
